# Node.js and TypeScript Environment Setup

This project sets up a foundational Node.js and TypeScript environment, including project initialization, TypeScript configuration, installation of essential dependencies, and version control integration. The goal is to provide a solid starting point for developing scalable and maintainable Node.js applications using TypeScript.

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates how to set up a new Node.js project with TypeScript. The setup includes:
- Initializing a Node.js project.
- Configuring TypeScript with a `tsconfig.json` file.
- Installing and configuring essential dependencies like Express for server-side functionality and MongoDB for database operations.
- Initializing a Git repository for version control and ensuring best practices are followed from the start.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up TypeScript configuration**:

    The TypeScript configuration is defined in the `tsconfig.json` file, which is initialized with `npx tsc --init`. This configuration ensures TypeScript compiles the code correctly.

4. **Run the development server**:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can start the development server using:

```sh
npm start

Code Quality and Formatting
ESLint and Prettier
This project uses ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and ensure consistent formatting.

Setup Instructions
Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Linting:
To check for linting errors in your code, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run lint
Formatting:
To format your code according to the project's Prettier configuration, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run format
Configuration Files
.eslintrc.json: Contains the ESLint configuration.
.prettierrc: Contains the Prettier configuration.
Scripts in package.json
"lint": Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
"format": Runs Prettier to format the code.
By following these steps and using these tools, we ensure our codebase remains clean, consistent, and easy to maintain.
